# Implementation of YOLOv5 on Custom datasets
This is an implementation of the YOLOv5 model on the custom datasets as implemented by @ultralytics. The results of the model that is the labels and the detected bounding boxes of the particular labels can also be saved in the .txt file. This method is important in the case of data-labelling where custom datasets are acquired and also processed.
